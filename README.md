This converts text into a string of numbers.
It uses huffman tree encoding based off of the King James Bible.
The binary is then converted into 3-bit integers, and can then be recorded/sent.
If the message can't be divided by three, then spaces are added until it does work.
In the future, I may add multi-threading to further speed up the already rediculous speed, just because I can.
